# id3-fix

While ripping CDs with Windows Media Player I noticed all the first tracks were
missing their id3 tag data. The ripping process starts automatically after the
disc is inserted (if that setting is enabled) and the tag data loads from the
disc too late for the first track. Every disc ripped has this trait. Instead of
manually correcting a few hundred ripped discs or re-ripping them, I'm just
correcting them with this short program.
